# scripts
just a bunch of scripts that I've made.

## move-i18n.sh script
It's a script that is used to copy files from a source directory to a target directory.
I've created it so I can use it in other scripts or programs, like I can copy localization files to multiple Mediawiki extensions directories.

### Usage:
    sh move-i18n.sh [ -s SOURCE ] [ -t TARGET ]
